Tests:
 - test inherited ruby methods? (e.g. to_s)
 - check that the class names are correctly set
 - somehow test garbage collection?
 
Ruby objects:
 - class/obj variables?
 - convert JS objects to RB hashes? (vice versa)
 - convert common func names? (e.g. to_s -> toString)
 - protect inspect calls?
 - modules?
 - extending?
 - do we need to rb_rescue anywhere else?
 
Misc:
 - should we support a way to maintain large number precision?
 - double check that unwrapping ruby objects works everywhere v8ToRuby is called
 - use existing ruby wrap when passed/returned
 - getting ruby globals
 - would TypedData_Wrap_Struct help prevent re-wrapping of already wrapped ruby objs?
 - convert to use nan
