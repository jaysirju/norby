Tests:
 - test inherited ruby methods? (e.g. to_s)
 - check that the class names are correctly set
 - somehow test garbage collection?
 
Ruby objects:
 - class/obj variables?
 - convert JS objects to RB hashes? (vice versa)
 - modules
 - extending?
 - do we need to rb_rescue anywhere else?
 
Misc:
 - should we support a way to maintain large number precision?
 - double check that unwrapping ruby objects works everywhere v8ToRuby is called
 - add support for RUby 1.8? ("<!(ruby -e 'require \"rbconfig\"; puts Config::CONFIG[\"archdir\"]')")
