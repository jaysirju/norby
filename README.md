[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/norby.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/norby)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rylanc/norby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rylanc/norby)

Call your Ruby libraries from node.js

```js
var ruby = require('norby');

var Time = ruby.getClass('Time');
var t = new Time(2014, 7, 2);
console.log('Year: ' + t.year()); // => 'Year: 2014'
console.log(t); // => '2014-07-02 00:00:00 -0400'
```

## To install

Prerequisites:

    * node.js >= 0.10
    * ruby >= 1.9

Install using npm:

```sh
npm install norby
```

Compile from repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rylanc/norby.git
cd norby
npm install
```

Run unit tests:
```sh
npm test
```

## What's missing

norby is currently in an early beta state. Check back for updates as features
are implemented. Feel free to add an issue for any bugs or missing features.

 - Windows support. node.js is built with Visual Studio while most Windows Ruby
   installers use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org). It may work if you build Ruby
   with VS, but I haven't tried it yet.
 - Support for Ruby version 1.8.X
 - Support for Ruby including/extending
 - Support for Ruby hashes
 - Conversion of JS objects (that aren't wrapped Ruby objects)
 - Support for Ruby structs
 - Support for Ruby global variables

## API

### ruby

  Exposed by `require('norby')`.
  
### ruby#require(name:String)

  Calls Ruby's [require](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-require)
  method with the specified `name`.
  
### ruby#eval(code:String [, binding:Binding [, filename:String [, lineno:Number]]])
  Calls Ruby's [eval](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-eval) method
  with the specified parameters.

### ruby#getClass(name:String)

  Returns a wrapped Ruby class specified by `name`. The `new` class method will
  be called when the constructor is called.
  
```js
var Time = ruby.getClass('Time');
var t = new Time(2014, 7, 2);
```
  
  To get a class within a module, separate the module and class with `::`.
  
```js
var ZlibInflate = ruby.getClass('Zlib::Inflate');
```

  Class methods and constants are exposed as properties of the constructor.

```js
var Time = ruby.getClass('Time');
var t = Time.utc(2014, 7, 2);

var File = ruby.getClass('File');
console.log(File.SEPARATOR); // => '/'
```

### ruby#newInstance(className:String [, â€¦])

  Returns a new instance of a Ruby object specified by `className`. Any
  additional arguments will be passed on to the class's   `new` method.

```js
var t = ruby.newInstance('Time', 2014, 7, 2);
```

### ruby#inherits(derived:Constructor, superName:String)
  
  Creates a new Ruby class (named `derived.name`) who's superclass is specified
  by `superName`. All public instance methods of `superName` will be added to
  the derived class's prototype. To add methods to the derived class, call its
  `defineMethod` function. This will add the method to the class's prototype and
  override the Ruby superclass's method. Adding the method to the prototype only
  will fail to override the superclass's method.

```ruby
# base.rb
class Base
  def call_me
  end
  def make_call
    call_me
  end
end
```
```js
ruby.require('./base');

function Derived() {
  Derived.super_.apply(this, arguments);
  this.val = 'Hello';
}
ruby.inherits(Derived, 'Base');

Derived.defineMethod('call_me', function() {
  console.log('In JS: ' + this.val);
});

var d = new Derived();
d.make_call(); // => 'In JS: Hello'
```

### ruby#getMethod(name:String)

  Returns a JS function that wraps the Ruby method specified by `name`. This currently only works with [Kernel](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html) methods.

```ruby
# hello.rb
def my_func (name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
```

```js
ruby.require('./hello');
var my_func = ruby.getMethod('my_func');
my_func('Stan');
```

### ruby#getConstant(name:String)
  
  Returns the Ruby constant specified by `name`. To get a constant within a module or class, separate the module and constant with ::. Without the separator, it returns an [Object](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/Object.html) constant. `getConstant` can also be used to return modules.

```ruby
# const.rb
module MyMod
  MY_CONST = "abcde"
end

class MyClass
  OTHER_CONST = "fghi"
end
```
  
```js
ruby.require('./const');
var RUBY_VERSION = ruby.getConstant('RUBY_VERSION');
console.log(ruby.getConstant('MyMod::MY_CONST')); // => 'abcde'
console.log(ruby.getConstant('MyClass::OTHER_CONST')); // => 'fghi'
```

## Ruby objects

### Methods

Wrapped Ruby objects expose their public instance methods through function
properties.

```js
var Time = ruby.getClass('Time');
var t = new Time(2014, 7, 2);
console.log(t.year()); // => '2014'
```

The Ruby `to_s` method is mapped to the JS `toString()` function.

```js
console.log(t.toString()); // => '2014-07-02 00:00:00 -0400'
```

Since node's `console.log()` function calls `inspect` with  a `depth` argument,
it is ignored when passed to the Ruby `inspect` method.

```js
console.log(t); // => '2014-07-02 00:00:00 -0400'
```

### Blocks

If the last argument in a method call is a function, it is passed to the method
as a Ruby block.

```js
var Regexp = ruby.getClass('Regexp');
var pat = new Regexp('.at');
pat.match('cat', function() {
  console.log('match!');
}); // => 'match!'
```

## Ruby Modules

To retrieve Ruby modules, call `ruby#getConstant`. Modules are returned as JS objects
with their class methods and constants as properties.

```ruby
# mod.rb

module MyMod
  MY_CONST = "abcde"
  
  def MyMod.say_hi
    puts "Hello"
  end
end
```

```js
ruby.require('./mod');
var MyMod = ruby.getConstant('MyMod');

console.log(MyMod.MY_CONST); // => 'abcde'
MyMod.say_hi(); // => 'Hello'
```

## Type conversion

### From node

#### `null` and `undefined`

Are converted to `nil`.

#### booleans

Are converted to Ruby booleans.

#### numbers

If the number can be determined to be an integer (`v8::Value::IsInt32()`), it's
converted to a Ruby `Fixnum`. Otherwise, it's converted to a `Float`.

#### arrays

Are converted to Ruby arrays. Their contents are recursively converted.

#### strings

Are converted to Ruby strings.

#### Ruby objects

Wrapped Ruby objects are unwrapped.

### From Ruby

#### `nil`

Is converted to `undefined`.

#### booleans

Are converted to JS booleans.

#### `Float`s

Are converted to JS numbers.

#### `Fixnum`s

Are converted to JS numbers. Keep in mind that JS stores numbers as double
precision floating point numbers, meaning that `Fixnum`s (and `Bignum`s) will
lose precision above 2<sup>53</sup>.

#### `Bignum`s

Are converted to JS numbers if they are less than or equal to `Number.MAX_VALUE`. Otherwise, they are converted into JS strings. See the above note about precision.

#### arrays

Are converted to JS arrays. Their contents are recursively converted.

#### strings

Are converted to JS strings.

#### `Symbol`s

Are converted to JS strings.

#### Ruby objects

Are wrapped as JS objects.

#### Ruby exceptions

Are caught within norby native code, converted to v8 exceptions and rethrown.
The thrown v8 exceptions have a `rubyStack` property that holds the result of
calling `Exception#backtrace` on the original Ruby exceptions.
